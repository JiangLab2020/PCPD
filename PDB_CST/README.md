# PDB_CST
we collected all relative information of heme and ligated CYS from all we collected all relative information of heme and ligated CYS from all P450 crystal structures, and constructed the PDB_CST database (dihedral angle, angle and distance data between heme, CYS and CYS adjacent amino acids).
